# Developing an Assistance System for Womenâ€™s Work Life Balance using Machine Learning

At the moment, a lot of researchers anticipate that artificial intelligence, and machine learning in particular, will improve many aspects of daily life for individuals, groups, and countries. For instance, it has been suggested that so called machine learning may soon relieve workers of some responsibilities, which may improve procedures or assist in determining the most efficient ways to do jobs. This project aims to find out work life balance status of working women. I have also tried to build some additional features that can help a working woman to live a balanced work life. Different kinds of ML (Machine Learning) classification algorithms were used for this purpose. I have also prepare a set of 22 attributes for appropriately classifying work life balance status. The data is examined. Several machine learning methods are tested using the dataset.  I have found K-Nearest Neighbour to be the most effective, with a classification accuracy of 98%. 

I have also developed a mobile application intigrating with the best-performed ml model.

This is my undergrade thesis project. I have uploaded my thesis report.
